Text       "tell guide help" doesn't do anything~
Body      A newbie tour guide is here to help. "Tell guide help" for assistance.
... however, when I enter that command, I get "No one by that name here."
Trying a few other words to refer to the tour guide, but notably the
one in the description doesn't work!
